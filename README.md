# hsplit
This is an addon for Ashita v4 that keeps track of you and your parties drops from HELMing (currently only mining and logging).<br><br>
**Please note that if you want to use this addon to split your drops, you'd still need a certain amount of trust between you and your party due to the way this addon keeps track of drops.**
# Usage
* `/hsplit`: Displays your parties HELMing in an imgui window
# To-do
* Display the value of your HELMing pool similar to hgather
* Nicer GUI
